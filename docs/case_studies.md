## Implementation Recommendations

Based on these case studies, we've identified the following best practices for implementing Artemis in production environments:

### Domain-Specific Considerations
1. **Medical Domain**: Prioritize accuracy over speed; use larger adapter sizes; implement specialized medical tokenization
2. **Legal Domain**: Focus on structured pruning; implement document chunking; prefer exact matches over generalization
3. **Multilingual Applications**: Use language-specific adapters; implement shared cross-lingual representations; tune tokenizer for each language
4. **Financial Applications**: Prioritize numerical accuracy; implement time-sensitive batching; create domain-specific attention patterns

### General Implementation Tips
1. Start with a domain-relevant base model when possible
2. Experiment with different LoRA ranks (8-32) based on domain complexity
3. Use structured pruning for domain-specific tasks, magnitude pruning for general tasks
4. Implement continuous evaluation with domain-specific metrics
5. Consider custom tokenization for domain-specific terminology
6. Balance adapter size with latency requirements
7. Leverage quantization techniques appropriate for the deployment hardware

## Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate that the Artemis framework delivers substantial real-world benefits across diverse domains. The combination of efficiency-transformer techniques, advanced pruning, and hybrid adapters consistently provides:

- 2.5-4x inference speedups
- 15-25% domain-specific accuracy improvements
- 50-75% reduction in computing resource requirements
- Significant business impact through faster, more accurate AI capabilities

Future work will focus on extending these capabilities to more domains and creating specialized components for emerging use cases.
