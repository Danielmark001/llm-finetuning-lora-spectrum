      "reference": "SGLT2 inhibitors act by inhibiting sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. This transporter is responsible for approximately 90% of glucose reabsorption in the kidney. By inhibiting SGLT2, these medications reduce glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion, thereby lowering blood glucose levels independent of insulin. This mechanism also leads to caloric loss, promoting weight reduction, and osmotic diuresis, which contributes to blood pressure reduction. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal protective effects beyond their glucose-lowering properties.",

Eye Opening: 4=spontaneous, 3=to voice, 2=to pain, 1=none. Verbal Response: 5=oriented, 4=confused, 3=inappropriate words, 2=incomprehensible sounds, 1=none. Motor Response: 6=obeys commands, 5=localizes pain, 4=withdraws from pain, 3=abnormal flexion, 2=abnormal extension, 1=none.

The initial medication regimen should include a loop diuretic such as furosemide for volume management, an ACE inhibitor or ARB for afterload reduction and cardioprotection (considering his diabetes), a beta-blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol) for mortality benefit, and potentially spironolactone if he has reduced ejection fraction without significant renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is essential, especially given his diabetic status.",
      "irrelevant_response": "The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately, as the bilateral crackles and lower extremity edema suggest community-acquired pneumonia with possible sepsis. I recommend starting with intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover typical and atypical organisms. Blood cultures should be obtained before antibiotic administration, and the patient should be assessed for the need for vasopressors if hypotension develops.",
